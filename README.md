# KTS2
Wolfram Mathematica code to build the probability distribution functions for secondary structure assignment in terms of cuvature and torsion of proteins backbone.

The probability distribution functions are build by the program scoring_sytem_construction
This program generates the files: *.dat. In particular the file probability_hsc_prot_186.dat is used by regions_kt.nb to build the 2D regions on the curvature-torsion space.
The program KTSS.nb assigns a secondary structure type to the residues of a given protein. This program has a manual: KTSS_User_s_Guide.pdf
